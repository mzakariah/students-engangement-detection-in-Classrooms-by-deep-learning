# students-engangement-detection-in-Classrooms-by-deep-learning
This model is building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model in Tensorflow using the Keras API to detect student engagement using the FER (Facial Expression Recognition) images dataset. The model consists of multiple layers such as Conv2D (Convolution 2D) layers, MaxPooling2D, Dropout, Flatten, Dense, BatchNormalization, etc.
